<h4>Lecture Notes</h4>





<p><strong>Exploring WordPress &amp; Configuring the wp-config.php File</strong></p>





<ul><li>The <strong>wp-config.php </strong>file contains all your settings from database login details to debug settings and hashes.</li><li>You’re free to modify the <strong>wp-config.php</strong> file without having to worry about it being overwritten in future updates.</li><li>The <strong>wp-includes</strong> folder contains functions and classes used throughout WordPress. The <strong>wp-admin</strong> file handles everything on the admin side of WordPress.</li><li>The <strong>wp-content</strong> folder contains all content created by the user and also stores all plugins and themes.</li></ul>





<p><strong>File Headers</strong></p>





<ul><li>The absolute minimum requirement for WordPress to recognize your theme officially is by creating 2 files named <strong>style.css </strong>and<strong> index.php</strong> along with a file header.</li><li>A<strong> file header</strong> is a block comment placed at the top of your files to let WordPress know more about your theme/plugin.</li><li>The information presented in a file header called meta-information. Meta-informat is formatted as <strong>name: value</strong></li><li>A <strong>Text Domain </strong>is a unique ID for your translations.</li></ul>





<p><strong>Functions File &amp; Action Hooks</strong></p>





<ul><li>WordPress will search for a file called<strong> functions.php</strong>. This file is completely optional. You can add logic to do heavy lifting behind the scenes.</li><li>The developer tools allow you to diagnose and debug your site. The console tab will output any messages and errors related to your site.</li><li>Action hooks allow you to hook into certain events. If an event occurs, then any functions that hook into the event will be triggered.</li><li>It’s important that you prefix your functions, classes and variables so you can avoid any naming conflicts with other code from plugins and the WordPress core.</li></ul>





<p><strong>Loading Styles &amp; Scripts with Enqueues</strong></p>





<ul><li>It’s always important to register scripts/stylesheets before enqueueing them. Registering will let WordPress know about your files while enqueueing will instruct WordPress to lose the files.</li><li>Prefix your file handle names to avoid collision and naming conflicts with other plugins/themes.</li><li>Use the <strong>wp_head </strong>and <strong>wp_footer </strong>functions to instruct WordPress where to load your files.</li><li>It’s important that you never override WordPress’ default scripts such as jQuery.</li></ul>





<p><strong>Adding Dummy Content</strong></p>





<ul><li>FakerPress allows you to generate fake content. Make sure you create fake users, terms and posts. </li></ul>





<p><strong>Menu Support</strong></p>





<ul><li>You can use WordPress’ built-in features by calling the<strong> add_theme_support()</strong> function and pass in the feature you’d like to take advantage of.</li><li>Once the menu feature is active, then you can register a menu using the <strong>register_nav_menu() </strong>function.</li><li>After a menu has been registered you can display it using the <strong>wp_nav_menu()</strong> function. If you have a menu with CSS classes for each item, then you’ll need to use a custom walker to output those classes.</li><li>WordPress provides a few functions for translating strings. If WordPress doesn’t find a translation, then WordPress will return the string as is.</li></ul>





<p><strong>Creating Header &amp; Footer Areas</strong></p>





<ul><li>Use the <strong>get_header() </strong>and <strong>get_footer()</strong> functions to load the header and footer sections of your template respectively.</li><li>WordPress requires a certain naming convention for the header (<strong>header.php</strong>) and footer (<strong>footer.php</strong>) files.</li><li>If you have multiple header/footer files, then you can pass in an extension. WordPress </li><li>The <strong>body_class() </strong>function  will load additional classes to the <strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag.</li></ul>





<p><strong>Creating Sidebar and Widget Areas</strong></p>



<ul><li>Sidebars can be placed inside their own template files called<strong> sidebar.php</strong>. You can grab a sidebar using the function <strong>get_sidebar()</strong>.</li><li>Sidebars also follow the same naming conventions as the header and footer. </li><li>It’s important that you keep your HTML/CSS for the widgets minimal as it can be hard to maintain with WordPress.</li><li>Make sure to check if a sidebar is active using the<strong> is_active_sidebar() </strong>function.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Formatting the Search Form</strong></p>



<ul><li>WordPress will search for a file called<strong> searchform.php</strong> and use it as a template for the search form displayed inside the search widget.</li><li>If the template is not found WordPress will automatically call the function <strong>get_search_form() </strong>which will generate a search form.</li><li>It’s important that you set the method to <strong>GET </strong>and that the input field has a <strong>name </strong>of <strong>s</strong>.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The Loop</strong></p>

They can be used inside or outside a loop.</li><li>Beware of using <strong>the_date()</strong> inside the loop. There are a lot of problems that come with this function. It’s better to use the<strong> get_the_date() </strong>function instead.</li><li>Post thumbnails come in various sizes. By default there 4 size aliases that WordPress defines for you. The original size of an image can be grabbed by using the full size alias.</li></ul>
